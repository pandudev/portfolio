# Frontend Boilerplate

This is my initial setup for frontend projects.
- Gulp
- SASS (7-1) pattern modified
- Webpack
- Babel
- BrowserSync

# How to Use
- Open this project in your editor (I used VS Code)
- "npm install" in terminal to load all package
- "gulp serve" in terminal to serve the project in browser
